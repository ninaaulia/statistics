### Background
The 365 team has developed a diet and an exercise program for losing weight. It seems that it works like a charm. However, you are interested in how much weight are you likely to lose.You have a sample of 10 people who have already completed the 12-week program.


### step by step

+ task 1 : `Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the dataset`
              
              1. mean : -20.02458725746
              2. standard deviasi : 6.85889281086411
+ task 2 : `Determine the appropriate statistic to use`
              *data has a normal distribution, sample < 30 so we'll using T distribution. **Ci 95%,t0.025** *

+ task 3 : `Calculate the 95% confidence interval`
            
             1. Ci low -24.9308027152603
             2. Ci hight -15.1183717996597

+ task 4 : `Interpret the result`
          
            *From 95% Ci, we can losing weight between -24.93 & -15.118 ibs (11 - 6 kg) after completing the 12-weeks program*






*ps : actually this exercise is using excel but I tried another way using python*
